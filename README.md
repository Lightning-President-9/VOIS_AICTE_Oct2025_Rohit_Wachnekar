## Problem Statement

The New York City Airbnb market is incredibly competitive. For a host, it's difficult to know how to:

This project addresses these challenges by analyzing a large dataset of NYC Airbnb listings to uncover key trends in pricing, availability, and popularity. The insights aim to help hosts make smarter, data-driven decisions to optimize their listings and increase rental income.
